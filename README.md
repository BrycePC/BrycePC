### Hi there üëã
Welcome to my Github site, where I am keen to share knowledge and discuss insights on all things related to cloud-native full-stack solutions on AWS!
Much of my learning outside of work is oriented around the creation and evolution of "The Better Store", an open-source sample eCommerce store implemented using the following methodologies and technologies:

* Domain Driven Design, to define a suitable decoupled, highly-sclable and agile Microservice Architecture using best practices.
* Design and impplementation of microservices based on the Onion Architecture (predominantly using Node.js) with AWS serverless techologies.
* Delivery of a full-stack application; ie microservices and a web-based frontend using Devops practices and Infrastructure as Code.

Please see references to my first 3 Medium articles below:

More are to come soon! A sneak peak of its working functionality is available at: https://thebetterstore.net, while its open-source respositories can be viewed at: https://github.com/TheBetterStore/
